## Initial setup

> **NOTE: You will need 2 terminals for this project to run!** (A split terminal works just as well)

### **First Terminal: The Server**

A `server` folder is provided with the backend code. This is a local server that you will connect to to retrieve/write the data.

#### Install the backend dependencies:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the server folder: `cd server`.
3. Install the required packages: `yarn install`
4. Once that's done you can start the server: `yarn start`

### **Second Terminal: The Website**

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the server folder: `cd client`.
3. Install the required packages: `yarn install`
4. Once that's done you can start using: `yarn start`
